In this chapter, we digress from nonlinear cointegration and demonstrate that our uniform asymptotics results of $S_{1n}(x)$ and $S_{2n}(x)$ can also be applied to unit root testing with nonstationary volatility. We propose a unit root test when the volatility process is driven by a nonlinear transformation of non-stationary time series. Our method involves replacing the nuisance parameter, which is a nonlinear function, by its consistent kernel estimator. This improves the existing literature for unit root testing with heteroskedasticity by using external data  explicitly. Our method also allows the effect of future volatilities being affected by current shock. Monte-Carlo simulations support our theoretical results.
