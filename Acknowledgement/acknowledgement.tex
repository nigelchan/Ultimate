I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my supervisor, Qiying Wang, for his continuous guidance and encouragement throughout my study. He has a sincere desire to provide me with inspiration to formulate research problems and support as I tried to overcome technical obstacles.

I am thankful to Prof. Peter Phillips, Prof. Peter Robinson and Prof. Richard Davis for their reading, comments and suggestions of parts of this work.

I would also like to thank the Commonwealth Government and the University of Sydney for financial support throughout my study in Australia.

Last but not least, I would like to thank my family and my friends for their continuous care and support in these three years of Ph.D. study.
