I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my supervisor, Qiying Wang, for his continuous guidance and encouragement throughout my study. He provided me with inspiration to formulate research problems and support as I tried to overcome technical obstacles.

I am thankful to Prof. Peter Phillips, Prof. Peter Robinson and Prof. Richard Davis for their reading, comments and suggestions of parts of this work.

I would also like to thank the Commonwealth Government and The University of Sydney for financial support throughout my study in Australia.

Last but not least, I would like to thank my family and my friends for their continuous care and support in these three years of Ph.D. study.
