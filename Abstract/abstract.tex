Nonlinear cointegration model has been a popular tools for applied econometric modelling. There are numerous real life examples that demonstrate nonlinear response to some times series arise in the field of macro-economics. The nonparametric estimation methods for the nonlinear linked function in the cointegration model has been studied extensively in the literature. Most of the existing studies concentrate on establishing point-wise convergence. The uniform convergence of the nonparametric estimator of the nonlinear function allows further extention to the nonlinear cointegration model, including incorporating a time varying nonstationary error strucuture.

The aim of this work is to establish the uniform convergence of the nonparametric estimator of cointegrating function, with sharp convergence rate and  optimal range for the uniform convergence to be held. We systematically investigate a class of martingale and a functional of non-stationary time series. Our framework supports for a wide choice of popular time series, including stationary mixing time series, stationary iterated random function, Harris recurrent Markov chains and I(1) processes with innovations being a linear process. Additionally, the established asymptotics has an application in unit root testing with nonstationary variance.

Furthermore, we also discuss the nonlinear parametric cointegration model. We establish a general framework for weak consistency that is easy to apply for various nonstationary time series, including partial sum of linear processes and Harris recurrent Markov chains. We provide limit distributions for nonlinear least squares estimators, extending the previous works. We also introduce endogeneity to the model by allowing the error to be serially dependent and cross correlated with the regressors.
